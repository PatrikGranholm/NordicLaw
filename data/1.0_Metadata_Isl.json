Beside the figure on the left, a depiction of the three-divided world is shown. Overall, the miniature is very similar to the one on f. 6r in AM 135 4to (Arnarbælisbók), AM 160 4to and Thott 1280 fol. It is likely that also here the depicted figure is Óláfr helgi Haraldsson). Historiated initials on f. 8v3-10 (Mannhelgisbálkr, ch. 1; two standing figures facing each other. Both are armed: The one on the left is holding a club in its heraldic left hand while one the belt a sword is attached. The figure on the right holds with its heraldic right hand an axe while also here a sword is attached to the belt. Furthermore, the second figure slabs the first in the face with an open hand), f. 24v13-20 (Landsbrigðabálkr, ch. 1; possibly historiated: The initial shows a figure riding on a horse and holding a trifoliate in its hraldig left hand), f. 38v16-24 (Landsleigubálkr, ch. 60 [Rekabálkr, ch. 1]; A figure is shown with an axe in both hands and cutting wood), f. 41v12-20 (Kaupabálkr, ch. 1; Two figures are depicted, as well as centrally in the front, a horse. The figure on the left holds its heraldic left hand up in a demanding gesture. The other figure on thje right holds up centrally an axe, presumably to kill the animal. The initial is extended into the left margin with acanthus and palmette motifs (with green and dark red backgrounds). In the lower margin, the initial letter extention ends with two grylli figures), f. 51r22-28 (Þjófabálkr, ch. 1; Two figures are painted in the initial, one hanging from the gallows with his hands bound on the back, the other holds up with its heraldic right hand the horizontal bar of the gallows while the other is placed on the left shoulder of the hanged figure). Decorated, often inhabitated initials are found on f. 1v1-8, f. 2r21-25, f. 5r7-13 (extended into the margins), f. 16r7-12, f. 17v21-27, f. 21v16-21, f. 26v16-24 (extended into the margins), ff. 29v-30r (with bas-de-page), f. 46v1-7, f. 55r1-7",
